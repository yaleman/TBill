TBill
=====

A simple, hacky parser for Telstra bill files supplied to corporate/large clients.
Focused on outputting mobile data usage, but may be gradually expanded as needs require.

Built on Python, relies only on the TKinter libraries which should be built in. I'll probably use it as my first Python 3.x project.
